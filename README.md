# Energy & Carbon-Aware AI Model Selection Framework

## Overview
This project implements a sustainability-aware machine learning model selection framework. 
It evaluates models using four metrics:

- Accuracy
- Energy Consumption
- Carbon Emissions
- Latency

The system supports deployment-aware decision making for:
- Edge Devices
- Cloud Servers
- Enterprise Systems

## Evaluated Models
- ResNet50
- MobileNetV2
- EfficientNet-B0
- Quantized-MobileNet (8-bit)

## Features
- CPU-based energy estimation
- Carbon footprint calculation (country-adjustable)
- Multi-objective sustainability scoring
- AutoML-based recommendation
- Pareto frontier visualization
- Streamlit interactive dashboard
